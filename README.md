# Remote sensing image captioning

The source code provided in this repository alows one to reproduce the results described on the following [paper](http://bmidb.cs.stonybrook.edu/publicdata/sigspatialproceedings/paper_10.pdf):

    @inproceedings{Santos2021a,
       author = {Rita Parada Ramos and Bruno Martins},
       title = {Remote Sensing Image Captioning with Continuous Output Neural Models},
       year = {2021},
       booktitle = {Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems},       
    }

The pre-recorded talk corresponding to the ACM SIGSPATIAL poster paper is also [available online](https://youtu.be/yqFu0XhcBRA).

A second paper, describing the method is more detail and presenting results both on the RSICD and UCM datasets is currently under revision:

       title = {Using Neural Encoder-Decoder Models with Continuous Outputs for Remote Sensing Image Captioning},
